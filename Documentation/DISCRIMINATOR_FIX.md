# 🔧 Discriminator Fix Applied

## ❌ **Issue Found**
The NFT minting was failing with error 3008 ("Invalid instruction data") because we were using the wrong instruction discriminator.

### **Wrong Discriminator Used**
- We were using: `afaf6d1f0d989bed` (initialize discriminator)
- Should be using: `d33906a70fdb23fb` (mint_nft discriminator)

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### **Updated Discriminators**
```typescript
const discriminators = {
  'initialize': [175, 175, 109, 31, 13, 152, 155, 237],
  'mint_nft': [211, 57, 6, 167, 15, 219, 35, 251], // ← FIXED
  'transfer_cross_chain': [156, 254, 121, 90, 64, 192, 182, 110],
  'receive_cross_chain': [117, 33, 7, 40, 221, 135, 87, 40],
  'on_call': [16, 136, 66, 32, 254, 40, 181, 8],
  'on_revert': [226, 44, 101, 52, 224, 214, 41, 9],
  'update_gateway': [11, 133, 146, 0, 122, 116, 10, 75],
};
```

### **Files Updated**
- ✅ `frontend/src/lib/universal-nft-service.ts` - Fixed discriminator generation
- ✅ Added helper method with pre-computed discriminators
- ✅ Browser-compatible implementation (no crypto dependency)

## 🧪 **Ready to Test**

The NFT minting should now work correctly! The transaction will use the proper `mint_nft` discriminator and should succeed.

### **Expected Behavior**
- ✅ Transaction simulation should pass
- ✅ NFT minting should complete successfully
- ✅ Program state `totalMinted` should increment to 1
- ✅ You should receive a real NFT in your wallet

Try minting an NFT again - it should work perfectly now! 🎨✨
